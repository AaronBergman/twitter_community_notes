Go get those Antifa bastards! And the random anarchists. And the Boogaloo Boys. And the BLM people. All those fascist thugs need to be dealt with.  How dare they dress like Trump supporters and make it look like it was Trump supporters that caused all the violence at the capitol.

For the anti Ozempic crowd:

A person has been dieting for 10+ years and hasn’t been successful. Tried many diets, goes to gym, etc

We all know that person. The “always dieting”

They haven’t succeeded 

Do you want them to continue to try (and fail) for another 10 years, end up…

A 15 % weight loss is not significant. And as soon as they stop those shots their weight returns. Also, all """"diets"""" fail. Until we address the ultra processed and hyper palatable food problems nothing will change. Eating real food is the only solution.

This raises the obvious question: can we ever rely on renewables to power the grid during extreme weather?

No, you need gas or nuclear. 

And subsidizing investment in wind has pushed gas and nuclear out.

That White man told the Black kid to just give up the bike he paid for to that White woman because..she felt entitled to it.  Thats the sort of perspective that White ppl, if they heard it from anyone else's lips, would call extremely un-American.

推進派はを促すために戸籍法の廃止まで目論んでる(サイボウズの社長がそうだった)。こうなると外国人の場合は出自が隠せるから背乗りまでできてしまう。
夫婦別姓は個々人の問題ではなく、日本を滅ぼす重大問題。単純な旧姓名乗る名乗らないの問題じゃないことを認識すべき。

So @kane is now falsely telling people that Jackie Fielder committed fraud. 

He knows it's a lie, but he's doing it anyway.

Tell him what you think about that.

There are a lot of big feelings about media bias in Canada since Oct 7, but not a lot of facts.

One big """"bias"""" exposé was written by a fictional CBC producer & included claims about CBC journalists who were never asked to comment. No verified facts. 

But I have some facts..

Do you honestly think John Rustad knew who Jordan Peterson was before this? Do you think John Rustad is hanging out on 4chan and sharing Pepe memes? He  obviously went on that show because his young staff thought it would be a good move, not because he's some Peterson fanboy.

JJ - if John Rustad is more like Joe Clark, why did he appear on Jordan Peterson’s show?  

Was he kidnapped and transported there?

And why is Rustad’s campaign joined at the hip with Pierre Poilievre’s?  

Joe Clark never would never appear on a show like Jordan Peterson’s.…

Não é novidade que IL é um partido libertário e não liberal. Mas se dúvidas restassem basta agora ler as reações do candidato presidencial e outras à vitória de Milei na Argentina. Não chegam o João Cotrim e o Guimarães Pinto para disfarçar.

If the CDC, Democrats, & media cared about #COVID, they would work as hard as possible to:

•End Obesity - 80% of covid hospitalization & deaths.

•Close the Border - stop spread of disease.

•Study & Promote Effective Treatments like HCQ & More.

But they care about control.

Notice how the narrative is now switching back to the “UN-V are the spreaders?” We’re the dangerous ones?

Businesses shuttered…

Workers forced to choose the jab or their jobs…



Biden, Wolf, and Shapiro stripped our rights and destroyed our economy

As governor, I’ll restore our freedoms and rebuild our economy

Wolf was one of five governors that had the Covid sick sent into the homes .  It triggered an explosion of Covid deaths of our dear elderly.   Levine knew it and evacuated mom to a hotel suite.  Lockdown Josh covered for Wolf and Levine as our loved ones were left to die alone.

The same mainstream media democrat activists that sold conspiracy theories for years about President Trump and Russia are now blaming @elonmusk for “internet misinformation” about Paul Pelosi’s friend attacking him with a hammer.

The media is source of misinformation.

Arizonans have no Faith & Trust in our Elections. 

Our Election Officials are incompetent (…or worse)
They have failed us. 

The Fake News ignores our Fake Elections and expect us to just “move on.”

We won’t. 

America will NOT survive if we don’t demand Election Reform NOW.

96% of abortions are because the woman just doesn’t want the child.

Not rape. Not incest. Not risk-to-life. Not severe illness.

They’ll stand on the 4% of abortions (which are legal in many states already) and pretend that the 96% of abortions just don’t happen.

They happen.

They’ve captured the Ukrainian line of defense behind Avdeevka and progressed south of Umansk. They also entered Terny today. You ignoring Russian advances doesn’t mean they aren’t happening

When biased “journalists” try doing the Liberals’ dirty work, they should at least get their facts straight.

One stat you won’t find in your Spotify Wrapped is how much artists are paid for all that listening on the platform. 

The max possible in 2023 is $0.003 per stream. And in 2024, Spotify will stop paying anything AT ALL for 2/3 of the tracks on the platform.

While the far left has been waging a national anti-police, anti-law-enforcement campaign, violent crime has soared from coast to coast. Cities are under siege.  Until federal, state, and local Democrats get with the program, innocent people will continue to suffer.

The Biden Administration’s approach to the border is failing America. They are stumbling through this core governing duty with no plan and backward priorities. Democrats would rather appease radicals with functional open borders than conduct the bare minimum in enforcement.

I derive my stance on abortion from Jesus Christ. 

Jesus believed that life begins at birth, as the Jews of his time did. 

He was REALLY specific about how we should treat each other and never ONCE mentioned the unborn.

Tavistock is being sued by 1000 families.  If you need an expert witness to explain why the hormones caused the vocal damage they did, and how to quantify it, please DM me as I've been looking forward to the lawsuit landslide for years now. I know what rehab will cost too.

The use of @birdwatch since @elonmusk bought Twitter has exploded. In the five days after the sale, *131 notes/day*. Compared to the *45/day* since Birdwatch context notes went public and before the sale.

Mel Gibson said that kids are raped, tortured, murdered during Satanic Ritual ceremonies. 

Megan Fox admitted her and Machine Gun Kelly drink blood. 

Allison Mack admitted she sold children to Bill & Hilary Clinton and the Rothschilds.

Oppenheimer brought us The Bomb... and sweet corn.

Corn seeds were deliberately exposed to US atomic bomb tests in 1946, just to see what would happen. Dr. John Laughnan was sorting that mutant corn & absentmindedly ate a kernel, discovering its sweet flavor, which he then bred.

Hunter Biden has been clean for 6 years. Joe Biden has never abused drugs. And Joe Biden loves his son Hunter more than anything.

Trump abuses cocaine and adderall. His eldest son abuses cocaine. And he hates all of his children, including Barron (for being taller than him).

A recent article in the Financial Times claims that there is an increasing ideological gender gap in several countries.
